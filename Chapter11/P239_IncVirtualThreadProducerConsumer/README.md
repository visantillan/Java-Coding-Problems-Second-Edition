# Solving the producer-consumer problem via virtual threads (increase/decrease consumers):

Refactor the producer-consumer problem developed in Java Coding Problems, First Edition, Chapter 10, Problem 204 to use
virtual threads and Semaphore instead of newCachedThreadPool().If you donâ€™t have that book then just give your own idea
and implementation or simply follow the code
from https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Java-Coding-Problems/tree/master/Chapter10.
