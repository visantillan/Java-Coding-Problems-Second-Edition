# Text blocks, Locales, Numbers & Math

This chapter includes 33 problems covering 4 main topics, text blocks, locales, numbers, and mathematical operations. We
will start with text blocks (elegant multiline strings introduced in JDK 13/15), continue with problems for creating
Java Locale including localized locales (JDK 19, ofLocalizedPattern()), and finish with problems about numbers and math
such as the Babylonian method for computing the square root and different corner cases of results overflow. The last
part of the chapter is dedicated to JDK 17 new API for pseudo-random generators.
