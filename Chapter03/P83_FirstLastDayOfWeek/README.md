# Getting the first and last day of the week:

Letâ€™s assume that we have an integer representing a number of weeks (for instance, 3 represents three consecutive weeks
starting from the current date). Write a program that returns the first and last day of each week. Provide a solution
based on the Calendar API and one based on the JDK 8 Date/Time API.
