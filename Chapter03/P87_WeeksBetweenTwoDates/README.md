# Getting the number of weeks between two dates:

Letâ€™s assume that we have a date-time range given as two Date or as two LocalDateTime. Write an application that returns
the number of weeks contained in this range. For the Date range write a solution based on the Calendar API, while for
the LocalDateTime range, write a solution based on the JDK 8 Date/Time API.
