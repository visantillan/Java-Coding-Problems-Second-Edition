# Converting week/year to Date:

Letâ€™s consider that two integers are given representing a week and a year (for instance, week 10, year 2023). Write a
program that converts 10-2023 to a java.util.Date via Calendar and to a LocalDate via WeekFields APIs. Also, provide the
vice-versa, from a given Date/LocalDate extract the year and the week as integers.
